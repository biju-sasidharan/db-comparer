    ### Data Migration Quality Checks
This proof of concept (POC) is an attempt to automate the basic quality checks that needs to be carried out during any data migration process. When data is moved from one environment to another, integrity is the key concern. 

*Prototype functionality:*
* Reduces the manual effort involved in quality checking during migration.
* Acts as a single interface incorporating functionalities from multiple libraries.
