# DB Comparison Tool

### Objective
The objective of the Use Case is to develop a web based solution that can automate the basic quality checks which needs to be carried out during any data migration process. 

### Background
When data is migrated from one environment to another using an ETL tool, data integrity is always the key concern. There are chances of data getting lost, inconsistency developed in schema (metadata), erratic keys getting generated and, incorrect data getting created etc. It is a cumbersome and time consuming job to manually identify these issues.

### App Offering
A customized approach that automates various quality checks that needs to be carried out on data after a migration process is completed. The prototype developed visually showcases the comparison results without step by step manual intervention. It also generates output from an in-built library called DataComPy (data comparison python package). 
This way it also acts as a single window that can output results from multiple sources â€“
